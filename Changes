Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tidy5.


5.00_01 Tue Mar 13 11:54:52 CDT 2018
====================================
Uses latest tidy-html5.  No longer needs tidyp.  Requires Perl 5.10.1.

This is the first beta release.  It has not been tested by anyone out in the world.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
The tidy-html5 library validates HTML5.

[INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH HTML::Tidy]
Removed the overloading of HTML::Tidy::Message objects.  Now you have to explicitly call ->as_string.
