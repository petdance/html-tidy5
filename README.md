HTML::Tidy5
===========
HTML::Tidy5 is an HTML checker in a handy dandy object.


PREREQUISITES
=============
HTML::Tidy5 does very little work.  The real work of HTML::Tidy5 is done
by the [html-tidy][1] library which is written in C.  To use HTML::Tidy5,
you must install html-tidy.  Your package manager probably has it, either
as "tidy" or "html-tidy" or "libtidy".  If there's an option to get a
"-devel" package, get that, too, because Perl needs the header files
in it.


INSTALLATION
============
Once you have libtidy installed via one of the previous methods,
install HTML::Tidy5 like any standard Perl module.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
